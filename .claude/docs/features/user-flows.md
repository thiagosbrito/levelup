## Error Flows and Edge Cases

### Connection Issues
- **Offline Task Completion**: Tasks can be completed offline, synced when connection restored
- **Partial Sync**: Handle partial data synchronization gracefully
- **Conflict Resolution**: Parent and child modify same data simultaneously

### Payment/Reward Issues
- **Insufficient Coins**: Clear messaging and earning suggestions
- **Gift Card API Failure**: Retry mechanism and customer support contact
- **Delayed Fulfillment**: Status tracking and communication

### Family Management Issues
- **Child Leaves Family**: Data retention and re-invitation process
- **Parent Account Deletion**: Family ownership transfer or dissolution
- **Inappropriate Content**: Reporting and moderation workflows

## Accessibility Considerations

### Navigation Accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: All navigation elements properly labeled
- **Voice Control**: Support for voice navigation commands
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility for navigation elements
- **Large Text Support**: Scalable navigation text and buttons

### Workflow Accessibility
- **Alternative Input Methods**: Support for switch controls and external keyboards
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect system preference for reduced animations
- **Color Independence**: Don't rely solely on color for navigation cues
- **Focus Management**: Logical focus order and clear focus indicators

## Performance Considerations

### Navigation Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Load screens on demand to reduce initial bundle size
- **Route Preloading**: Preload likely next screens based on user patterns
- **Transition Optimization**: Use native transitions for smooth navigation

### Data Loading Patterns
- **Progressive Loading**: Show basic UI immediately, load data progressively
- **Background Sync**: Update data in background while user navigates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Show expected results immediately, reconcile later
